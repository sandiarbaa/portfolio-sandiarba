              Full-time as a Full-Stack Developer, contributing to the
              development of the Fund-Request feature, which includes Advance,
              Expense, and Reimburse to support the companyâ€™s operational needs.
              This feature enables employees such as sales, drivers, and
              collectors to request travel funds, record expenses, and submit
              reimbursements. The company had several internal applications for
              different divisions, such as the Sales Activity App, Delivery App,
              and Collection App. I initially developed the Fund-Request feature
              in one application, and later replicated and implemented it across
              the other division-specific apps. The Front-end was developed with
              React.js and React Native (Expo), while the Back-end was built
              with .NET, resulting in a more integrated, transparent, and
              efficient internal financial system.
